# 🌍 Translation App using Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM)

This is a translation app built using Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM), which allows to share code between Android and iOS platforms. The app provides a simple interface for translating text between different languages, as well as text-to-speech 🗣️ and voice recognition 🎤 features.

Note: I made this application following [Philipp Lackner](https://github.com/philipplackner) course. 

## 🚀 Technologies and Frameworks

Sure! Here's the updated list of technologies and frameworks with their respective emojis:

### Android Module

- 💉 **Hilt**: A dependency injection framework that simplifies the process of managing dependencies in your app.
- 🎨 **Jetpack Compose**: A modern toolkit for building native UIs on Android, using a declarative approach.
- 🌅 **Coil**: An image loading library that provides fast, efficient, and lightweight image loading for Android apps.
- 🎡 **Turbine**: A testing library for asynchronous code that provides simple and concise APIs for testing coroutines and flows.
- 📜 **Truth**: A testing library that makes assertions more readable and provides informative error messages.

### Shared Module

-  **Kotlin**: A modern programming language that is concise, expressive, and interoperable with Java.
-  **SqlDelight**: A database library that generates typesafe Kotlin code from SQL statements.
- 🚀 **Ktor Client**: An HTTP client library that provides a simple and flexible API for making HTTP requests.
- 🎡 **Turbine**: A testing library for asynchronous code that provides simple and concise APIs for testing coroutines and flows.
- 🌀 **Coroutine**: A concurrency library that simplifies the development of asynchronous and non-blocking code.
- 🌊 **Flow**: A reactive stream library that provides a simple and composable API for processing data asynchronously.

### iOS Module

- 🎨 **Swift UI**: A modern framework for building native UIs on iOS, using a declarative approach.

## 🔊 Text-to-Speech and Voice Recognition

The app also includes text-to-speech 🗣️ and voice recognition 🎤 features, which allow users to listen to the translated text and input text using their voice.

### Text-to-Speech

The text-to-speech feature uses the Android and iOS platforms' built-in text-to-speech engines to convert the translated text into speech. This feature is platform-specific.

### Voice Recognition

The voice recognition feature uses the Android and iOS platforms' built-in voice recognition engines to convert the user's speech into text input. This feature is platform-specific.

### Future Plans
 - [ ] Determine the language of a string of text using [MLKit Language identification](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/language/identification).

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the app, you need to have Android Studio and Xcode installed on your machine. You can then clone the project from GitHub and open it in Android Studio or Xcode, depending on which platform you want to run the app on.
